# Web Services with Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate

## Overview

This project is a backend application developed in Java using Spring Boot, JPA, and Hibernate. It serves as a foundational template for building RESTful web services, focusing on the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and the management of entity relationships.

## Features

- **Entity Modeling**: Defines core entities such as Users, Orders, Products, and Categories, establishing clear relationships between them.
- **Layered Architecture**: Implements a structured approach with distinct layers:
  - **Entities**: Represent the domain models.
  - **Repositories**: Handle data access using Spring Data JPA.
  - **Services**: Contain business logic.
  - **Controllers**: Expose RESTful endpoints.
- **Exception Handling**: Provides a global exception handler to manage and return meaningful error responses.
- **Database Integration**: Configured to work with H2 for testing and PostgreSQL for development and production environments.
- **Testing**: Includes test cases using Postman to validate API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- Maven
- H2 Database (for testing)
- PostgreSQL (for development and production)

## Architecture

Below are visual aids that help understand the structure and design of the project.

### 1. Domain Model

This diagram illustrates the main entities (`User`, `Order`, `Product`, `Category`) and their relationships. It helps visualize how the data model is organized.

### 2. Domain Instance Example

An instance of the domain model showing real or example data in use. Useful for understanding how entities relate in practice ‚Äî e.g., a `User` placing an `Order` with several `Products`.

### 3. Logical Layers

This diagram represents the **logical architecture** of the application. It highlights the separation of concerns between Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Entities ‚Äî a standard practice in clean, maintainable Spring Boot apps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- PostgreSQL (if not using H2)

# üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pro-gabrielteixeira/web-Spring-Boot-JPA-Hibernate.git
cd web-Spring-Boot-JPA-Hibernate
```

### 2. Configure the Database
By default, the application runs using an in-memory H2 database.

To use PostgreSQL:

1. Open the file `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
2. Replace the datasource properties with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
```

3. Create the database manually:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database;
```

### 3. Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

# üîç Exploring the API
You can test the RESTful endpoints using tools like:

- **Postman**
- **Insomnia**
- Your browser (for GET requests)
